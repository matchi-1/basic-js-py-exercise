/*
    Create a function that extracts only the last date in a string. The format 
    should be <Month> <Day>, <Year> (example: January 1, 2020). 
    
    Sample Input: 
    The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon
    Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army
    of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed. Spanish colonialism began with the arrival
    of Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. 
    
    Sample Output: 
    'February 13, 1565'
